---

### Which clustering algorithm?

- Different algorithms will emphasise different aspects of clustering structure

--

- Choosing one 'best' model often arbitrary, unclear choice

--

  - `r emo::ji("right arrow")` **Inference not calibrated for model-based uncertainty**

--

- Locking into one method loses insights offered by other methods about plausible clustering structure

### Combining Clustering Results with Bayesian Model Averaging

--

- Limited development for Clustering
  - Finite mixture models (Russell et al., 2015)
  - Naive Bayes classifiers (Santafe & Lozano, 2006)
  - Lacks implementation across multiple clustering algorithms

--
<br>

**Advantages**

- `r emo::ji("cool")` Weighted averaging of results incorporating model quality / goodness of fit

--

- `r emo::ji("100")` Intuitive framework for **probabilistic** inferences combining results from **different clustering algorithms**

--

- `r emo::ji("wow")` Each input solution can have a different number of clusters $K$

--

- `r emo::ji("sunglasses")` **Quantify model-based uncertainty and enable more robust inferences** calibrated accordingly




---

### Bayesian Model Averaging: Basics

<br>
<br>

$$P(\Delta | Y) = \sum_{l=1}^L (\Delta | Y, M_l)P(M_l|Y)$$



--
<br>
<br>

$$P(M_l|Y) = \frac{P(Y|M_l)P(M_l)}{\sum_{l=1}^L P(Y|M_l)P(M_l)}$$


---

#### BMA for Mixture Models - BIC weighting
- $P(Y|M_l)$ typically involves a difficult/intractable integral and is often approximated for many applications (Fragoso et al., 2018)

--

- **Russell et al. (2015)** weight results from multiple GMMs according to BIC

$$P(M_l \lvert Y) \approx \frac{exp(\frac{1}{2}{BIC}_l )}{\sum_{l=1}^L { exp(\frac{1}{2} BIC_{l}) }}$$

--

- BIC definition for GMM

$${BIC}_l = 2\log(\mathcal{L}) - \kappa_m \log(N)$$

--

- GMM likelihood

$$\mathcal{L}(\Theta) = \sum_{n=1}^N \sum_{k=1}^K{\pi_k\mathcal{N}(x_n|\mu_k, \Sigma_k)}$$
--

- Multivariate Gaussian density

$$\mathcal{N}(x|\mu, \Sigma) = \frac{\exp\left\{ -\frac{1}{2} (y-\mu)^T \Sigma^{-1}(y-\mu)\right\}}{|\Sigma|^{\frac{1}{2}} (2 \pi)^{\frac{D}{2}}}$$

### New proposed weighting / approximation for posterior model probability

BIC for GMM driven by **Multivariate Gaussian density:**

$$\mathcal{N}(x|\mu, \Sigma) = \frac{\exp\left\{ -\frac{1}{2} (y-\mu)^T
                 \Sigma^{-1}(y-\mu)\right\}}{|\Sigma|^{\frac{1}{2}} (2 \pi)^{\frac{D}{2}}}$$
                 

--

**Calinski-Harabasz Index**
- Ratio of separation to compactness (maximise)
$$CH = \frac{\sum_i{n_i d^2(c_i,c)/(NC-1)}}{\sum_i{\sum_{x \in C_i}d^2(x,c_i)/(n-NC)}}$$

--

**S_Dbw Index**

- Sum of intra-cluster scattering and inter-cluster density (minimise)
<center>
```{r out.width=400}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/S_Dbw_short.jpeg")
```
</center>


- CH and S_Dbw indices are both well validated in the context of comparing model quality across different clustering algorithms

---

### New proposed weighting / approximation for posterior model probability

CH and S_Dbw indices
- conceptually and mathematically similar to BIC
- Unlike BIC, can be calculated + directly compared across different clustering algorithms

--

New proposed weight:
<!-- $$P(Y \lvert \mathcal{M}_m) \approx \hat{\mathcal{W}}_m \coloneqq \begin{cases} -->
<!--   \frac{\mathcal{W}_m}{\sum_{m'=1}^M \mathcal{W}_{m'}} & \text{if $\mathcal{W}_m$ is to be maximised} \\ -->
<!--   \\ -->
<!--   \frac{\frac{1}{\mathcal{W}_m}}{\sum_{m'=1}^M \frac{1}{\mathcal{W}_{m'}}} & \text{if $\mathcal{W}_m$ is to be minimised,} -->
<!--   \end{cases}$$ -->


.center[
```{r out.width=800}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/cbma_eqn_wt.png")
```
]



<br>

--

Approximate posterior model probability for weighted averaging:
$$P(\mathcal{M}_m \lvert Y) \approx \frac{\hat{\mathcal{W}}_m \left(\frac{1}{M}\right)}{\sum_{m'=1}^M \hat{\mathcal{W}}_{m'} \left(\frac{1}{M}\right)} = \hat{\mathcal{W}}_m.$$


---


### Consistent quantity $\Delta$ - Similarity matrices

Previous work (Russell et al., 2015) has used pairwise similarity matrices as $\Delta$ for each model

--

- To get similarity matrix, multiply allocation matrix by its transpose:

$$S_m = A_m A_m^T$$

- **invariant to number and labelling of clusters across solutions**

--

.center[
```{r out.width=800}

### Consensus matrix

\begin{equation}
  C = {\sum_{m=1}^M\hat{\mathcal{W}}_m S_m}.
\end{equation}

---

### Consensus matrix `r emo::ji("right arrow")` Matrix factorisation `r emo::ji("right arrow")` Cluster allocation probabilities

- Symmetric Simplex Matrix Factorisation (SSMF; Duan, 2020) to get $N \times  K$ allocation matrix $A_m$ from $N \times N$ consensus matrix $C$

- Generates probabilistic cluster allocations from pairwise probabilities
